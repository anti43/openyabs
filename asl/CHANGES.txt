Version 1.0.2 (released February 25, 2009)

Changes:

- The documentation is now packaged along with the scripts, making them
  available offline.
- Removed optional jar files from the default download. If you call any script
  target that requires an optional jar, you will be prompted to run the
  automatic download script. This makes the download much smaller for those
  people who don’t use any of the reporting features.

  install an application jar, along with all its library dependencies and
  configuration into an application assembly.
